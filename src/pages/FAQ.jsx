      questions: [
        {
          q: "How much can I save on business energy bills?",
          a: "Businesses typically save between 20-45% on their utility bills. We've helped over 900,000 businesses save a combined Â£150 million. Your exact savings depend on current rates, contract length, and consumption levels."
        },
        {
          q: "Is there a fee for your services?",
          a: "No, our service is completely free to businesses. We receive commission from energy suppliers when we successfully arrange a new contract. You only pay for your energy usage at the agreed rates."
        },
        {
          q: "Are there any hidden costs?",
          a: "Absolutely not. We believe in complete transparency. All costs are clearly outlined in your contract, and we'll explain every charge before you sign. Our commission comes from suppliers, not from you."

      category: "Switching Process",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How long does the switching process take?",
          a: "The initial consultation takes just 5 minutes. The complete switching process typically takes 4-6 weeks, depending on your current contract terms. We handle all paperwork and supplier negotiations for you."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens when my current contract ends?",
          a: "We monitor your contract end dates and contact you 6 months before expiry to secure the best new rates. This prevents you from rolling onto expensive out-of-contract rates."
        },
        {
          q: "Will my supply be interrupted during the switch?",
          a: "No, there's absolutely no interruption to your supply. The switch happens seamlessly behind the scenes. You'll continue receiving uninterrupted service throughout the entire process."
        },
        {
          q: "What information do I need to provide?",
          a: "We'll need a recent utility bill, your current contract end date, and basic business information. That's all we need to start finding you better rates."
        }
      ]

    {
      category: "Services & Coverage",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "Which utilities can Watt Choice help with?",
          a: "We provide comprehensive utility management including business electricity, gas, water, broadband, telecoms, and merchant services. We're your one-stop shop for all business utilities."
        },
        {
          q: "Can you help with multiple business sites?",
          a: "Yes, we specialize in multi-site energy procurement and can manage portfolios of any size. We've successfully managed contracts for businesses with 1 to 1000+ sites."
        },
        {
          q: "Do you work with small businesses?",
          a: "Yes! We work with businesses of all sizes, from sole traders to large corporations. Our expertise helps businesses with any level of energy consumption."
        },
        {
          q: "Do you offer green energy options?",
          a: "Absolutely. We can source 100% renewable energy contracts and help you reduce your carbon footprint. We also offer fully funded solar solutions with no upfront costs."
        }

    },
    {
      category: "Contracts & Terms",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "What contract lengths are available?",
          a: "We offer flexible contract terms from 1 to 5 years. We'll advise on the best length based on market conditions and your business needs."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I leave my current contract early?",
          a: "It depends on your current contract terms. We'll review your contract and advise if early exit is possible and beneficial. Sometimes paying exit fees can still result in overall savings."
        },
        {
          q: "What is a Letter of Authority (LOA)?",
          a: "An LOA gives us permission to negotiate with suppliers on your behalf. It doesn't commit you to anything - you remain in full control and only switch if you're happy with the new rates."
